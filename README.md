# Machine-Learning-Basics

Welcome to this Python Machine Learning tutorial. This repository contains a set of concepts and detailed explanations to help you understand and apply machine learning techniques using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Contents
- **Classification and Regression Models**: Implementation and evaluation of models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use of techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and T-SNE to visualize and reduce the dimensionality of data.

- **Clustering**: Application of clustering algorithms such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to group unlabeled data.

- **Model Evaluation**: Methods to evaluate the performance of models using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

This tutorial is designed for both beginners and those with prior machine learning experience who want to dive deeper into using Python for data analysis and predictive modeling.
